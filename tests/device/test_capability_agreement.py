"""The support table and the controller, asked the same question.

Two components decide whether a target can apply a capability. The table
decides before the device opens, so a scenario it refuses is skipped. The
controller decides at the device, so a scenario it refuses has already spent
a step.

They have to agree. A table that refuses what the controller can do skips work
the target could have done, and says nothing about it. Two iOS capabilities
were implemented and receipted this way, and reachable on no target at all.
The controller grew a driver path, and the table still described the command
line it replaced.
