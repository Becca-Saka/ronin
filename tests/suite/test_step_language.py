"""The words a prose step may open with, and where they come from.

The list is mapped from `ActionType` and `CapabilityKind` rather than typed
out. A hand-written one allowed five verbs for capabilities that do not
exist, so a model was invited to write steps the agent would fail on.

The scan itself is here too. It holds a sentence to opening with an action
and to carrying no claim, which is as much as an opening word can decide. A
typed step needs none of it.
