"""Whether the text lands in the field that was tapped, after the form moves.

Tapping a field opens the keyboard, and a form that scrolls to clear the
keyboard carries the field away from the point that named it. The point then
measures a move the tap itself caused, so it cannot say whether the tap found
the right field.
