"""Reading the eval corpus, and turning a fixture into real objects.

A fixture is data, not Python. That is the whole point of it. A unit test and
the code it tests move together, because whoever changes the code can change
the test in the same edit and the suite stays green. A fixture file holds the
answer a maintainer decided on, in a file no refactor has a reason to touch.

Two kinds live here.

- A **verdict fixture** holds the evidence a run produced and the one word it
  must add up to. It needs no model and no device, so it is exact.
- A **screen fixture** holds a screenshot, the rules to put to it, and the
  answer each rule must get. It needs a model, so it is read over several
  replicates and reported as stable or not.

Every file is read through a model that refuses an unknown field and a wrong
shape. A fixture is the thing a gate trusts, so nothing about one is taken on
the strength of a key being present.
