"""The failures Ronin recognises, and the ones that surprise it.

Each of these leads somewhere different, and `except Exception` collapses them
into one:

- a device Ronin cannot drive
- a screen Ronin cannot read
- an action the device refused
- an artifact Ronin could not write
- a command that asked for something absent

An adapter over a driver, a subprocess or the filesystem may still catch
broadly, because an SDK can raise almost anything. It then translates what it
caught into one of these types. Above that line, each handler names what it
expects.
