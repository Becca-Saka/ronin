"""The shape of a ronin.yaml.

One file holds the settings and the tests, so a typo in it can mean either a
setting that does nothing or a test that never runs. Every key is declared and
every value constrained, and anything else stops the run naming the key.

These models describe the file. `config.py` resolves the settings from them
and `suite.py` turns the rest into workflows, so one declaration answers for
both. The JSON Schema editors read is
generated from these models by `tools/emit_schema.py`, so the two cannot
disagree.
