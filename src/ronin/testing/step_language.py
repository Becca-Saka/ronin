"""The words an instruction may open with, and the scan that holds it to them.

The verbs are mapped from `ActionType` and `CapabilityKind` rather than
typed out. A hand-written list drifts from the code beside it, and ends up
offering words for capabilities that do not exist. A test catches a member
with no verb, and a verb with no member. So a new capability reaches the
generator, and a removed one leaves it.

A verb is not an action. An instruction is prose for the planner, which turns
"Select the card option" into a tap. So one action carries several verbs, and
the map says which action each verb is asking for.
