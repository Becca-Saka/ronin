"""Deciding which scenarios come from the lock and which must be generated.

The data is in `lock.py`. This is the policy, kept apart so one module holds
the file's shape and the other holds what a run does about it.

Three states of the lock, and two commands.

- **No lock.** `ronin test` generates it, writes it and runs. `--locked` fails.
- **A fresh lock.** Both read it and run. Neither writes.
- **A stale lock.** `ronin test` regenerates those cells and runs, loudly.
  `--locked` fails.

That is `npm install` against `npm ci`. Local work never thinks about it. CI
asks for a hard failure rather than a silently different test.
