"""The two axes a scenario sits on, and the cells a run covers.

A scenario carries two independent facts: what it looks for, and what shape
it takes. One field can hold only one of them. A category with no type beside
it leaves the shape unsaid. A generator fills that silence by re-walking the
declared journey, which spends a device and adds no evidence.

So the axes are separate. A category says what to look for. A type says what
shape the test takes. Neither decides a scenario alone, and a cell is one
pair of them.

Ronin enumerates the cells from the coverage a file declares, and the
generator fills one cell per call. The model answers how to test one thing.
The file answers what to test. Priority belongs to a product rather than to a
category, so the file carries that too.
