"""What a scenario does, as a typed list rather than a list of sentences.

A step says what it is, so nothing has to be read out of a sentence.

Two things follow. A value entered and the sentence the planner reads come
from one object, so they cannot name different values. The outcome is written
from that same object. A device state carries the typed capability, so what a
scenario needs is read off its own steps. Declared beside them, the two could
disagree.

Only an action on a control stays prose. The planner finds that control on
whatever screen the app shows, so a fixed target would fail the first time a
layout moved. A prose step is held to opening with an action and to carrying
no claim, which is as much as an opening word can decide.
