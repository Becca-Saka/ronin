Two kinds of refusal live here, and both happen before a scenario spends a
step finding out.

The first reads the scenario's prose for evidence Ronin does not collect. The
second reads the capabilities the scenario declared against the target in
front of it. Support is not a property of the platform alone. `adb emu geo
fix` needs an emulator console, `cmd locale` arrived in API 33, and a
screen-reader toggle needs the screen reader installed.
