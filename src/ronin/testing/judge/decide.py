"""One scenario's verdict, decided from what the run recorded.

Nothing here touches a device or a model. It takes the evidence a run
produced and returns one word about it. The same decision is then reached
twice: once at the end of a live run, and again over stored evidence.

That second path makes the decision testable as data. A fixture holds the
evidence and the verdict it must produce. A change to the ranking then shows
up as a fixture that stopped agreeing. A unit test would instead be edited to
match the new behaviour, in the same commit that changed it.

The ranking itself lives in `verdicts.py`. This module holds the order the
checks run in, and each check names the cause it reports.
