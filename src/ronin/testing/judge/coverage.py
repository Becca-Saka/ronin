"""Accounting for security rules across a whole journey.

Scoping a rule to the scenarios that can reach it stops a sign-in test being
failed for not evidencing a checkout rule. Taken alone that leaves a hole: a
rule no scenario ever reaches disappears quietly. The suite closes it — every
rule has to be evidenced by at least one scenario, or be named as unevidenced.
