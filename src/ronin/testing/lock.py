"""`ronin.lock` — the test, committed, so two runs can be compared.

A cell key is not a test. `security.negative.0` can name a scenario about a
rejected password this week. Next week it can name one about a locked
account. Both are faithful to the same journey file. One passed and one
failed, and whether the app broke is unanswerable: the file is identical and
the test is not the same test.

So the yaml locks the question, and this file locks the test. It holds the
walk, the expected outcomes and the setup, keyed by `scenario_uuid`, and it
is reviewed as a commit. `ronin.yaml` is `pyproject.toml` and this is
`uv.lock`.

Two things it deliberately does not hold.

- **No resolved value.** An entry keeps `{{rejected_password}}`, not `abc`. A
  lock holding values would hold a credential, and would change with the
  environment rather than with the test.
- **Nothing derived.** `steps_instructions` and `required_capabilities` are
  read off the steps by a validator. Storing them would let a stored value
  disagree with the derivation that produced it.

It locks the test, not the outcome. The agent may still walk the same steps
differently, and the auditor still judges every run.
