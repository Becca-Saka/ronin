"""How sensitive each artifact a run writes is, and what may be done with it.

A run leaves screenshots, prompts, logs, reports and a video. Ronin masks
what a journey declared across most of them, and covers declared values on
screen before an image is written. One artifact is covered by neither: the
recording. Nothing masks a video frame, so a password typed on screen is in
it.

So the class is declared here rather than left to whoever uploads. A list
kept by an uploader is a list somebody has to remember to update when a run
starts writing something new. A class in the record travels with the file.

Four classes, by what has been done to the artifact. Not by how bad it would
be to leak.

- `derived` holds nothing from the app at all.
- `scrubbed` had every declared value masked by name.
- `redacted` had every declared value on screen covered before it was written.
- `unmasked` had nothing done to it.

`unmasked` is the one that decides a policy. A journey that declares no
secret has nothing to mask, so the class says the same thing and the policy
reads it differently.

Retention is declared beside it, and **Ronin enforces none of it**. Nothing
here deletes a file. A run writes into a directory the user chose, and
clearing it is theirs to do. The declaration is for whatever keeps these
afterwards, so a store does not have to invent a policy per file type.
