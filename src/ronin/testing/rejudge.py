"""Deciding a stored run's verdicts again, with no device and no model.

The record is the evidence a run leaves. It is only evidence if the verdict
in it can be reached again from the rest of it. That was not true until the
judge's inputs were kept. A record held the verdict and the auditor's
answers alone. Nothing in it could tell a changed rule from a changed app.

So this takes one scenario out of a `run.json` and asks the judge what it
would answer now. The judge is the same function a live run calls. It is
given the same inputs, out of the file rather than out of a walk.

**This reads a record. It never writes one.** A verdict reached again is an
answer about the code. It is not a correction to what happened. A record
that could be rewritten after the fact is not evidence.

What reads this today is the test that proves a record is sufficient. The
report that shows a reader which verdicts moved is a later phase, and it
brings its own presentation.
