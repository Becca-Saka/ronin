"""`run.json` — one record per run, and what every report is a view over.

This is the file that answers "what happened", against the lock's "what is
the test". It lists every scenario before the first one starts, and updates
each as it finishes. So it can be read, or tailed, while the run is going.

That is what the scenario plan did. This is that same writer, grown into the
whole record rather than joined by a second file. A second writer of a run's
outcome would be the fifth, and they could disagree.

Four things it carries that no earlier artifact did.

- **`schema`**, read before anything else in the file.
- **Identity**: the build, the target, the commit and the job.
- **Inputs**: the lock and the configuration this run was given, as hashes.
- **Per-step records**, so a reader can ask which step, and not only how many.

Every string in it is scrubbed. It is an artifact, so it is uploaded,
attached to a review and kept.
