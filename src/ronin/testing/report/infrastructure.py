"""The rows a run writes about itself, rather than about the app.

A suite reports one row per scenario. Three things that are not scenarios
also have to reach the report. A reader of a red build would otherwise look
for them in the app. They are:

- a run that was interrupted, whose remaining scenarios never ran
- a scenario whose model service would not answer
- a report Ronin could not write

Each carries `cell="infrastructure"`, which is what says the row is about
Ronin. Each also carries a cause, so the reader is pointed at the provider,
the device or Ronin rather than at the app.
