"""Writing one scenario for one declared cell.

One call used to produce the whole suite, and the model chose the topics, the
count, the test data and the identity of every scenario. None of those are a
model's to choose. A category with no type beside it leaves the shape of a
test unsaid. A value invented for an app the model cannot inspect is a guess.

So Ronin enumerates the cells and asks for one scenario each. The model is
told which cell, handed the values it may use, and answers with the walk and
the outcomes. Ronin stamps the identity, because Ronin knows which cell it
asked about.

A journey's security rules reach a security cell only. The auditor reads
every rule on every screen of every scenario already, so a cell about
something else gains nothing from seeing them. A security cell needs them,
because reaching the screen where a rule can break is navigation that only
an instruction can ask for.

### The app, as a user walks it

"{description}"

### The cell

Category: {category} — {category_meaning}
Scenario type: {scenario_type} — {type_meaning}

Write a scenario of that shape, about that concern, and nothing else. Ronin
covers every other cell in its own call.

### The values you may enter

An `enter` step names one of these. Never write a value of your own, because
only the file knows what this app does with a value.

{lines}
{rules}
### The steps

Give the steps in order. Each one is:

- `enter` — a declared value, and the field it goes in.
- `capability` — a device state, such as the network going offline.
- `action` — one action on one control, in prose. Open it with one of:
  {actions}.

The first step opens the app. The steps after it include every action that
reaches the screen this cell is about. Name a control by its visible text and
never by its position.

Put no claim in a step. A separate component judges the outcomes, and the
agent walking the app never reads them. An agent told what must be true
steers the app until it is. The finding then goes unreported.

### The outcomes

Say what has to be visible, and give the evidence that settles each one:

- "current_screen" — true or false from one screenshot. Prefer this always.
- "transition" — the run reached a screen, or moved between two.

Never write "run_timing". Nothing Ronin records measures time, and one timing
outcome reports the whole scenario as unproven.

Ronin can read screenshots, on-screen text, and the result of an action. It
cannot read network traffic, HTTP headers, the app's own logs, an
accessibility tree, a screen reader, focus order or a contrast ratio. Write
no outcome that needs one of those.

Ronin writes its own outcome for every value the file says this app
refuses. A step entering one needs no claim from you.
