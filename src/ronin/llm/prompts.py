"""Keeping what each model call was asked.

`llm_calls.jsonl` kept every answer and no question. So every claim about
what a prompt said was a reconstruction from the code that builds it. A
prompt that changed between two runs could not be read back at all.

Three rules decide the shape of this.

- **Content-addressed.** A prompt is named by its own hash. Two calls that
  asked the same thing keep one file, and no index has to be written.
- **Screenshots referenced, never embedded.** An image reaches a prompt as a
  base64 data URL. That is about a megabyte of text per step. The stored
  prompt keeps the image's hash instead. The screen itself is already on
  disk, beside the step that read it.
- **Scrubbed, like every other artifact.** A prompt carries the values the
  planner types, so it carries whatever the journey declared.

The hash is written whether or not the body is. A run that must not persist
model inputs can still say that two runs asked the same thing.
