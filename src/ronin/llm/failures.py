"""Which provider failures are worth another attempt, and which are final.

A model call fails for reasons that want opposite answers. A rate limit or a
dropped connection says to wait and ask again. A malformed request or a
rejected key says the next call will fail the same way. Asking again then
spends a device the suite is holding.

Read by type first and by status second. A type is what the client promises,
and a status is what the service said. Neither is read from the message text,
which is written for a person and changes between versions.
