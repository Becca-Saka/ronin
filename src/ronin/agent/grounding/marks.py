"""Numbering the detected elements so a target can be named rather than guessed.

A coordinate answer cannot be checked. Any pair of numbers is structurally
valid, so an element the planner cannot find becomes a tap into empty space.
Numbering the detections makes the answer a choice from a known set, and an
index that names nothing fails before anything touches the device.

The screenshot labels and the prompt labels are generated here, from one pass,
so the two cannot drift apart.
