"""What each step leaves behind on disk.

Every file a step writes starts with that step and the moment it was read, so
one step's files sit together and one glob finds them all. What kind of file
it is comes last. The step is padded, because a listing orders names by
character and would otherwise put step 10 before step 2.

Both writers go through the media manager rather than straight to disk. These
files outlive the run, so the manager covers a declared secret on screen first.
The scan dump goes beside them, which keeps a step's screenshots and the
reading they came from together.
