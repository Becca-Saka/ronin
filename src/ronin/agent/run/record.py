"""One step of a run, written down as it happens.

A report says a scenario failed and how many steps it took. It cannot say
which step, what the agent believed at the time, what it aimed at, or what
the device did about it. Those facts were logged in prose and then thrown
away, so every question about a past run was answered by rereading a log.

Each record is built across one turn of the loop: the screen, then the plan,
then the target, then what the device reported. A step that ends the run
early keeps the fields it reached and leaves the rest absent. Absent means
the step never got that far, and is never written as a zero or an empty
string that would read as a result.

Every string here is persisted. So every string here is scrubbed, by
whoever writes it down.
