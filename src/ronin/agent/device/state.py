        Android names the prompt: it is drawn from a package of its own, so the

        matters there because drift recovery presses back, and back on a
        permission prompt denies it, after which the journey fails several
        steps later for a reason that looks nothing like a denial.

        iOS answers False, and the alternative is worse. Appium reports an
        alert for the app's own modals too, with nothing to tell the two apart,
        so claiming a prompt there would tell the planner an app dialog belongs
        to the system and must not be dismissed. Being wrong on iOS costs
        little by comparison: recovery brings the app forward rather than
        pressing back, so no permission is answered by accident.
