"""Waiting for a freshly launched app to settle on its first real screen.

Launching is not instant on any toolkit. The window exists before anything is
drawn into it, and many apps then show a splash before the first real screen.
A screenshot of either hands the planner a screen the app is not on. An empty
one cannot be told from a crash, and a splash gets interacted with.

Nothing here inspects the UI toolkit. A launch is over when the screen has
something on it and is no longer changing wholesale, however it was drawn.
Some screens animate forever, such as spinners, carousels and video, and never
go completely still. So content that has held for a while also counts.
