"""Giving the device back the way a scenario found it.

Scenarios share one device, and `SetupMode` restores the app rather than the
system around it. A scenario that goes offline, or moves the clock, or switches
the screen reader on, leaves it that way for every scenario after it. The next
one then tests a device nobody configured, and its verdict is about a state it
never declared.

So each scenario reads the states a capability could change, and writes back
the ones that moved. Reading first is what makes this honest. A state that
could not be read is not restored, because restoring it would write a value
that was never observed.
