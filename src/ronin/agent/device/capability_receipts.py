"""What the device says about the state a capability just asked for.

Kept apart from the code that applies a capability. Reading a state is a
different question from setting one, and the answer has different rules. A state nothing can read reports None. The command is then the only evidence
there is, and a receipt invented for it would say more than is known.

The driver answers first here too. It reads most states on both platforms,
where adb reads some and simctl reads almost none.
