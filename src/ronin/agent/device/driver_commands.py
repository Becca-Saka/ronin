"""The `mobile:` vocabulary, in one place.

The session already holds a driver, and the driver wraps most device state on
both platforms. It also reads back what it sets, which adb and simctl mostly
do not: `getConnectivity` answers the question `setConnectivity` asked, and
`queryAppState` answers `terminateApp`.

Reaching past the driver to adb or simctl means hand-building argv twice, once
per platform, and inventing a read for each. So this is the first place a
capability looks, and adb or simctl is the fallback for what the driver has no
method for.

Two kinds of call, named apart on purpose. `change` must work, and raises when
it does not. `ask` is a read, and answers None when the driver will not say. A state that
cannot be read is not the same as a state that is wrong.
