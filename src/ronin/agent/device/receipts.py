"""Reading back the device state a capability asked for.

An adb command exiting 0 says the command ran, not that the state changed. A scenario about being offline is evidence of something only if the device
really was offline. So each capability that can be read is read, and the answer
travels with the request that produced it.

Where no read exists the receipt carries `observed=None`. That is not a
mismatch and does not refuse the capability. It says the state could not be confirmed, which is not the same as the state
being wrong.
