"""The `xcrun simctl` surface, in one place.

The iOS counterpart to `AdbControl`. Every simctl argv is built here. The values a subcommand accepts then sit
beside the call that sends them, rather than at each place one is used.

simctl drives simulators only. A physical iPhone needs `devicectl`, which offers almost none of this. A
capability that reaches this class is already one a real device cannot have.

Two kinds of call, as in `AdbControl`. `run` must succeed and raises when it
does not. `ask` is a read and answers None. The distinction matters more here
than on Android, because several simctl subcommands report a refusal on stdout
and still exit 0.
