"""Setting the device states a scenario asks for.

Every capability arrives as its own model, and every one is dispatched by an
explicit case. A capability this platform cannot apply raises, because the
alternative is a scenario that reads as having run offline while the device
stayed online.

The driver comes first and adb or simctl second. The session already holds a
driver, the driver speaks to both platforms in one vocabulary, and it reads
back what it sets. A command line is the fallback for what it has no method
for, and for a device the driver answers about but cannot change.
