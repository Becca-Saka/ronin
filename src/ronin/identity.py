"""What produced a run: the commit, the build, the app and the device.

A report that says a scenario failed, and cannot say which build it failed
on, is not evidence of a defect. Two runs of one journey differ by the app,
the device and the commit first. They differ by what Ronin decided second.

Every reader here is allowed to find nothing. A machine with no git, an app
Ronin cannot parse, and a device that reports no model are all ordinary.
Each one reports `None` rather than guessing or raising. A run must not end
because its own identity was unreadable.
